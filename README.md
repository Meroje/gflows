GFlows provides a templating mechanism for GitHub Workflows, using Jsonnet. It comprises a CLI tool that can:

* Import existing workflows into GFlow templates.
* Validate GitHub workflows are up to date with their source templates.
* Watch changes to the templates, so you can develop and refactor workflows with instant feedback on your changes.

## Installing

    go get github.com/jbrunton/gflows

## Getting Started

You'll probably want to run the `init` command the first time you use GFlows:

    gflows init
